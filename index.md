## About

I received the B.Eng. degree in software and computer engineering from Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea, in 2017. I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Engineering at Ajou University. I am a member of the Embedded Inteligent System (EIS) lead by Dr. JeongGil Ko. I am also a member of the Computer Systems Lab (CSL) lead by Dr. Jeongseob Ahn. My research interests include embedded learning system, mobile computing and healthcare applications. (email: ajm100@ajou.ac.kr)
